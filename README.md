##### Original Paper data can be found and downloaded here along with thier codes: https://zenodo.org/record/3981400#.Y1mceYLMKDU


## Dataset curation and preperation: 


## Baseline CNN:
The baseline CNN codes can be found in the BaselineCNN directory. These codes will do some preprocessing, and running of the baseline CNN. The code for testing the weak supervision model and creating the confusion matricies can also be found here.

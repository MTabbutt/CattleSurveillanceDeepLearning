## 11 - Making_datasets_from_thier_videos:

- Need to make balanced and unbalanced dataset of frames using their data in order to validate our use of their CNN and provide a baseline for the rest of the project. Do this pre-processing and creation locally and then move data onto the GPU for running the CNN. Going to use as many frames as possible within a reasonable ability to transfer the dataset to the CS nodes. 
- Pre-process the frames to be greyscale and 256 resolution before the transfer. 



### 30 - Preparing Vizuals for Experiments:

- Obsolete - We are doing our testing procedure differently. See notebook 31.
